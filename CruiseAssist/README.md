# CruiseAssist

## What's this?

Adjust the orientation to the target planet or star when moving between planets or star systems.

You can set the target by selecting it in the indicator, by selecting it in the star list, or by facing the star.

Original mod: [CruiseAssist](https://thunderstore.io/package/tanu/CruiseAssist/)  
It was discontinued, so I made a fork of it.
